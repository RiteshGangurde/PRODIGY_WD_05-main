## Weather Web App

1. This Weather Web App is a responsive and user-friendly tool designed to provide real-time weather information for any location. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers the following features:

2. Real-Time Weather Data: 
The app fetches up-to-date weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) for the user's current location or any searched city.

3. Interactive UI: 
The interface is clean and modern, with dynamic background changes that reflect the current weather conditions. For example, the background turns cloudy on a cloudy day or sunny when it's clear outside.

4. Geolocation Support: 
Users can automatically detect their current location using the browser's geolocation API to get the local weather instantly.

5. City Search: 
A search bar allows users to enter the name of any city worldwide to check the weather conditions there.

6. Responsive Design: 
The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

7. Error Handling: 
It includes error messages for invalid city names or if the weather data cannot be retrieved, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project is an excellent demonstration of front-end development skills, showcasing how HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript brings it to life with dynamic and interactive features.
